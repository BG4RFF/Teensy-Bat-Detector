Semiprofessional bat detector with the Teensy 3.6 microcontroller &amp; Teensy audio board

I developed this bat detector in the hope that it will promote the study of bat calls by everyone who is interested in the natural history and bioacoustic of bats AND/OR interested in the technical details of how the detection of ultrasound signals can be performed with high tech-low cost equipment.
