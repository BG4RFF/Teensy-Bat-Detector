Teensy Bat Detector

Development History


07-11-2016		github
- github site set up
- newest software v1.2 on github
- Wiki set up and filled with first information


07-11-2016		Version v1.2
- Recording of ultrasound on SD card (using uSDFS lib) (works up to 192ksps)
- Time expansion playback of recordings with lower sample rates
- sample rates 8k, 11k, 16k, 22k, 32k implemented


03-11-2016		Version v1.1
- Recording of ultrasound on SD card (using SD lib) (works up to 96ksps)


02-11-2016		Version v1.0
- added waterfall display showing spectrogram (by Frank B, thanks!)


02-11-2016 		Version v0.3
- added two separate detectors that scan the FFT results for ultrasound peaks in realtime
  These peaks are indicated by a RED "BAT!" sign in the display AND the estimated frequency
  of the peaks is being displayed for some time until it is deleted again, when no bat is present anymore.
  The frequency of the peaks is very easy to determine, as the location of the peak bin of the FFT 
  can easily be determined and indicates the frequency of the peak. It is more than adequately accurate
  for bat detection (bin bandwidth is 375Hz at 196k sample rate), but could potentially made much more accurate by three-point-interpolation.

01-11-2016		Version v0.2
- x-axis indicators for the spectrum display (dynamically adjusted when changing sample rates)
- logo (sorry, couldnÂ´t resist ;-))
- minor fixes
- now local oscillator frequencies down to 0 Hz are allowed (not useful for bat detection, just for the user
 to be able to understand and interpret the different heterodyne tones that you hear: 
 F_bat - F_LO and F_bat + F_LO can be heard, if you tune below 10kHz, try it)

 
01-11-2016		Version v0.1
- heterodyne detection
- pushbuttons to adjust for MIC GAIN, SAMPLE RATE, OSCILLATOR FREQUENCY


31-10-2016		first experimental version
- sample rate code by Frank Boesing implemented
- spectrum display of ultrasound (96ksps)
